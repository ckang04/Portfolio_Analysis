# Summary of Portfolio Analysis

*In the present analysis, we look at eight different portfolios and compare the return on each portfolio in order to make a recommendation for investment. The portfolios evaluated in this analysis include **Soros Fund Management LLC, Paulson & Co. Inc., Tiger Global Management LLC, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Algo 1, Algo 2, S&P 500, and My Portfolio.** The daily returns for each portfolio from the past five years were examined. Other calculations performed in this analysis includes:*
- Annualized Standard Deviation 
- Rolling Standard Deviation
- Sharpe Ratios
- Correlation Table
- Beta 

"My Portfolio" is comprised of five stocks: Amazon (AMZN), Boeing (BA), Crispr (CRSP), Microsoft (MSFT), and Paypal (PYPL).

# Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate the portfolios with the highest annualized standard deviation (252 trading days) were My Portfolio **(0.015929)** followed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc **(0.012320)** and Tiger Global Management LLC **(0.011744).** The annualized Sharpe ratios are as follows ordered from highest to lowest:
1. My Portfolio; **1.520944**
2. Berkshire Hathaway Inc; **1.150313**
3. Algo 1; **1.219600**
4. S&P 500; **1.057555**
5. Algo 2; **0.902318**
6. Soros Fund Management LLC; **0.600427**
7. Paulson & Co. Inc.; **-0.526451**
8. Tiger Global Management LLC; **-0.661589**

Sharpe ratio is an important calculation because it measures the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio. Generally, the higher a fund's Sharpe ratio, the better its returns have been relative to the amount of investment risk it has taken, which is measured by standard deviation. As demonstrated above, My Portfolio has the highest annualized standard deviation but it also has the highest Sharpe ratio which indicates that the fund's risk to return relationship is more proportional. Conversely, Tiger Global Management LLC had one of the highest annualized standard deviation and lowest Sharpe ratio. 

A correlation analysis was also conducted in the study and found that Algo 2 has the highest correlation with the S&P 500 (0.857146). Based on the information provided, My Portfolio woud be the best investment for investors who are willing to take more risk for a higher return. The second *best* recommmendation for the investor who is more risk adverse would be Algo 2 as it closely follows the S&P 500.
